# Personal Help System - Getting Started

A Real project based on the ESP32 that will provide you with a fully functioning PERSONAL HELP SYSTEM

Hello, and welcome to my channel.

This is a series of videos that will guide you through the building of a 'Personal Help System' developed around the very powerful,
 e s p 32, Microcontroller.

This 'Personal Help System', is very versatile and feature packed, it can be remotely controlled, monitored and configured, using your mobile phone from anywhere that has a mobile signal.  Locally, an S.O.S call can be activated by a physical button on the unit, by Remote Radio Frequency devices, or your mobile phone.

I will guide you through sourcing the components, connecting them to the ESP32, and programming them using the Ardwino IDE. I will also supply all the necessary links to download the libraries and documentation.

You will learn how to install and use the correct libraries for each component module.

My name is Harry, I am a hobbyist software engineer and an amateur electronic maker.  I won't deny, I'm not the neatest programmer, but my programs are well tested, well thought out, and reliable. This particular system was developed and tested over a 2 year period, and was initially made to help a relative who now has this installed in his home. it gives him the peace of mind that up to 4 family members or friends or any combination, can be contacted at the press of a button from anywhere within his house, or garden in the event that Help is needed.

I also have a friend who owns a retail shop, and uses it for his assistants who all have a remote device in their pockets in case a problem arises.

This Personal Help System is not limited to the purpose that I have used it for, it can be installed in many situations, including.

A Shop.
A Bar.
A Restaurant.
Even a Car, Van, Lorry or Boat.  as long as it has, a 12 Volt, 2 Amp (min), power supply, and a mobile phone signal, then it will work.

Basically, anywhere that someone might find themselves in need of help or assistance.

The project is set out in Modules so that you can follow along at your leasure.  Prove and test each stage as you go, and finaly have a fully functioning Personal Help System to be proud of.
